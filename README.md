# Overview

This repository contains my midterm project for analyzing strawberry data from California and Florida. The project is divided into two main parts:

1. Chemical Treatments  
   - Focuses on three fungicides (Sulfur, Captan, Pyraclostrobin)
   - Highlights usage differences between states

2. Price & Volume Trends  
   - Compares conventional and processing strawberries
   - Explores historical trends across years


# Files

- Midterm_strawberries.qmd  
  The Quarto source file containing all the analysis code and commentary.  
- Midterm_Project.pdf  
  The rendered PDF report, which combines explanations, plots, and final insights.  
- strawberries25_v3.csv  
  The dataset (survey data only) used in this project.


# Key Insights

- Chemical use is much higher in California, indicating scale/climate differences.
- Price vs. volume shows how supply might influence market value.
- Processing vs. Fresh (conventional) reveals distinct production strategies.


# License / Collaboration

- This project was done individually. No code was borrowed from classmates.
